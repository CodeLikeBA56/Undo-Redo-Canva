# Project Title

A small React + Next.js project that demonstrates how to implement Undo and Redo functionality using mouse clicks on a canvas-like area. Each click places a circle on the screen, and you can undo or redo your actions using keyboard shortcuts or buttons.


## Features

- Click anywhere inside the canvas to place a circle.
- Undo (Ctrl + Z / Cmd + Z) removes the last circle.
- Redo (Ctrl + Y / Cmd + Shift + Z) restores the last undone circle.
- Circles are placed accurately based on the clicked position.
- Responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS.



## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (react 18)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- UUID for unique circle ids

## How it Works

1.	Each time you click on the canvas, a new pointer (circle) is added to the pointers state array.
2.	If you perform an undo, the last circle is moved from the pointers stack to a redoStack.
3.	If you perform a redo, it moves back from the redoStack to the pointers stack.
4.	The UI re-renders automatically to reflect the current state.
    
## Keyboard Shortcuts

| **Action** | **Shortcut** |
|--------|-----------|
| **Undo** | `Ctrl + Z or Cmd + Z` |
| **Redo** | `Ctrl + Y or Cmd + Y` |

## Key Learnings

1. Managing undo/redo state using two stacks (undo and redo).
2. Handling keyboard events safely inside Reactâ€™s useEffect.
3. Using relative positioning to place elements precisely inside a container.
4. Preventing default browser undo/redo behavior using e.preventDefault().
